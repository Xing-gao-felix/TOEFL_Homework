The reading lists several arguments to support the idea that the decline of Torreya can be address in some ways. The speaker in the listening concedes that there are several problems about the solutions which are supported by the reading.

First, the reading claims that people can reestablish Torreya in the same location, because the microclimate is very comfortable to Torreya's growth. The lecturer,  however, argument by mentioning that globle warming change the microclimate. The wetlands are becoming drier and the temperature warmer than before, thus the microclimate is not suit for Torreya anymore.

Second, the reading mentions that moving Torreya to a different location where the temperature is cooler. But the speaker mentions that moving Torreya to another place  will threaten the plants which are live there. The lecturer give us a exmple about Black Locus. People move this plant to a new place and then it grow very fast in there. At last, this plant kills others. So this solution is not a good idea.

Third, the reading suggests that researchers can preserve Torreya in research centers. The speaker argue, research centers can not keep the genetically diverse of Torreya. Thus Torreya can not defense diseases in the long term.
