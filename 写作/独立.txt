There have lots of discussion about how to improve students' life quality. As for which is the best way to spend the fund, ideas vary. Some people say that providing a quiet place for study is a good choice. Others support that providing a place for entertainment is the best way. In my view, however, building a room for physical exercise is the most resonable choice.

First of all, building a exercise room in the dormitory can help students to save time and  engage more students in physical exercise. Because students always have lots of schoolworks, they don't want to waste lots of time on the way to gyms. Thus, if the university build a gym in dormitories, it will enable more students to join exercise.
For example, in this semester, our university build a new gym which is near by my dormitory. I go to the gym after dinner, everyday. In the past, if I want to do some exercise, I need to go to the playground. I will waste 1 hour on the way. And people cannot use the playground when the weather is bad. However, now, I can walk to the gym in 5 mins. It's so convenient.

Second, the library is a quiet place for study, so students don't need a new place. The library is the best place for study. Because it is very quiet and there have lots of resource. For example, I prefer to review the final exam in the library. In the library, I can pay my all tension on my study, so my work efficiency will be improve.

Further more, students can do various entertainment in their rooms. Nowdays, most of students have personal computers. They can use their computers to play video games, watch movies and listen music. For example, I always play OverWatch with my room mate in our dorm.

To sum up, building a room for physical exercise is the most resonable way to improve quality of students' life.
