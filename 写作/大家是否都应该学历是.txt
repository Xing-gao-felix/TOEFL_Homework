History is important as it shapes our nation today. It is a mirror reflecting us an thus is essential to our self-identity. After all, the best approach to knowing and judging ourselves is seeing our selves in ohters. A. E. Stevenson was definitely right in stating, "We can chart our future wisely and clearly only when we know the path which has lead to the present. "

All students should be required to rake history classes, regardless of their own acadaemic interest. Like it or not, we are all travelers in time who constantly draw on our past individual experiences in judging the present; and if we haven't individually experienced anyting similar to the present situation that we are in, we draw on our collective memory-the very thing that we call history. And since we view presnt occurrences from this time perspective, the past decisions and actions also set precedent for our future options and precautions. Why are we intensely concerned about the mass killings in Rwanda? That's because we know about the atrocities of Hitler and Mussolini. Why are there on-going, concerted efforts to curb the reavages of the Black Death and TB. And why do we believe lofty statesmen are just human?
